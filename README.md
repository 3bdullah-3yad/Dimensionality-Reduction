# Dimensionality-Reduction

**This technique is about taking your full dataset and reducing it to only the parts that hold the most information.**

## Dimensionality Reduction through Feature Selection and Feature Extraction
With large datasets, we often suffer from what is known as the "curse of dimensionality," and need to reduce the number of features to effectively develop a model. Feature Selection and Feature Extraction are two general approaches for reducing dimensionality.

## Feature Extraction using PCA
Principal Component Analysis is a common method for extracting new "latent features" from our dataset, based on existing features.
Note: Latent features are features that aren't explicitly in your dataset.
